TextUtil.sln and projects created using Visual Studio 2013/.Net 4.5

Recommended to start the review from WordCounterTest.cs file in TextUtil.Tests, as thats the place where the development started and it shows and explains how the TDD flow has unfolded.

TextUtil.Gui project provides the GUI to use the word counter and TextUtil.ConsoleApp is the console app for the same.
